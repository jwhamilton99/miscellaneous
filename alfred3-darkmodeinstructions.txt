if you have Alfred 3, add the following:

	tell application "Alfred 3"
		set theme "[dark theme name]"
	end tell

after the second "tell application "System Events"", and

	tell application "Alfred 3"
		set theme "[light theme name]"
	end tell
	
after the third "tell application "System Events"".

Replace the [light theme name] and [dark theme name] with your preferred theme, using the name as it appears in the Appearance preferences in Alfred.
